Climate change refers to long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. 

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching. They include melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent and intense hurricanes, droughts, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Agriculture is affected as crop yields change due to shifting rainfall patterns, temperature extremes, and pest outbreaks. Water resources may become scarce or contaminated, and human health can be impacted by heatwaves, vector-borne diseases, and air pollution. 

Mitigation strategies involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms. Adaptation strategies include building resilient infrastructure, protecting coastal communities, developing early warning systems for extreme weather, and promoting water conservation. International cooperation, such as the Paris Agreement, is critical to limit global warming and coordinate collective action to address this pressing issue.
