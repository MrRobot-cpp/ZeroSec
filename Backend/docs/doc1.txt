Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. As technology evolves, cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, including malware, ransomware, phishing, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Organizations must implement layered defenses, combining firewalls, intrusion detection systems, endpoint protection, and robust authentication mechanisms. Cybersecurity also involves continuous monitoring, incident response, and compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001. Human factors play a critical role, as social engineering attacks often exploit employees’ trust. Additionally, emerging technologies like AI and machine learning are being leveraged for threat detection, anomaly analysis, and automated remediation. A proactive approach that includes regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and user training is essential for maintaining security in a constantly changing threat landscape.
