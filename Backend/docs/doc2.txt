Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of Earth's climate patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. Consequences include melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent and intense weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Climate change also affects agriculture, water resources, and human health. Mitigation strategies involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms. Adaptation strategies include building resilient infrastructure, protecting coastal communities, and developing early warning systems for extreme weather. International agreements, like the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global warming and coordinate collective action to address this critical challenge.
