Space exploration involves the investigation and study of celestial bodies beyond Earth’s atmosphere. It has led to significant scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and a better understanding of our universe. Early space missions focused on orbiting Earth and lunar exploration, while modern missions aim for Mars, asteroids, and deep space. Space agencies such as NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and CNSA conduct both manned and unmanned missions to study planetary geology, atmospheres, and potential habitability. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are transforming access to space with reusable rockets and commercial satellite deployment. Challenges include life support, radiation exposure, long-duration space travel, and planetary protection. Innovations from space exploration often spin off into everyday technology, including satellite communication, GPS, medical imaging, and advanced materials. The long-term vision includes human colonization of Mars, asteroid mining, and interstellar exploration.
